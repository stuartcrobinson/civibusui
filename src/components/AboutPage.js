            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Civibus makes North Carolina campaign finance data accessible and understandable.
              We believe local politics shapes our communities in profound ways, yet critical
              information about campaign funding often remains buried in scattered forms and
              databases.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              While national campaign finance receives significant attention, local races often
              lack the same scrutiny, even though these are the elections where decisions about
              schools, housing, public safety, and infrastructure are made. By structuring and
              analyzing campaign finance data from North Carolina's municipal and county elections,
              we aim to empower voters, journalists, and researchers with the transparency tools
              they need to understand who funds local campaigns.

              We compile campaign finance reports filed with the North Carolina State Board of
              Elections and county boards, then present this data through interactive
              visualizations and detailed analyses. Our platform tracks:

              Our Values
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Compliance matters.</strong> We believe candidates have a responsibility
              to file complete, accurate, and timely campaign finance reports. Through our work,
              we've documented instances where reporting requirements aren't metâ€”and where
              penalties aren't enforced. Effective governance requires timely disclosure.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Shared responsibility.</strong> Making campaign finance work isn't just
              the government's job. It requires effort from candidates, voters, elected officials,
              and civic organizations. Civibus is our contribution to that collective effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Usability over availability.</strong> Public data should be publicly useful.
              We transform raw filings into formats that make it easy for citizens and journalists
              to understand the influence of money and interest groups in local politics.

              Who We Are
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Civibus was founded by Stuart Robinson, a Durham resident who has lived in North Carolina since 2002. The organization arose from watching money play an increasingly prominent role in Durham elections and recognizing the need for better tools to understand these financial dynamics in local races. Stuart holds a B.S. in Economics from Duke University and has previously worked as a software engineer, research science analyst, and touring musician.
